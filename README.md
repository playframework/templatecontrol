# TemplateControl

This is an internal script to update the Play managed example templates, to automate version management.

For the given templates in `application.conf`, it will:

* Clone the given template
* Create a new branch based off upstream version (i.e. upstream/2.6.x)
* Search and replace text to ensure that the relevant Play settings are correct, i.e. sbt-plugin, scalaVersion, sbt version, libraries etc.
* Git add and push the branch, and create a pull request against the upstream repo.

Because this is new, it is still up to a human to identify the pull request as passing the build hooks and merging it against the template.

## Prerequisites

### Hub

You need to have `hub` installed, see <https://hub.github.com/>.

### Project forks

You need to have forks for each of the repositories in your personal GitHub account.

For that you can use the scripts `scripts/create-forks-play.sh` and `scripts/create-forks-lagom.sh`.

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for more details.

### Personal Access Token

You will need to configure Github with a personal access token to get this working, because it does push branches into your personal fork of the templates in order to create the pull request.

You want a personal access token with "repo" scope.

<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/>

Then you need to create a script with your settings:

```
export TCONTROL_GITHUB_REMOTE=wsargent
export TCONTROL_GITHUB_USER=wsargent
export TCONTROL_GITHUB_OAUTH=<personal access token>
```

### Public Key for SSL access

Template control will use `https` when interacting with the upstream repos and `git` protocol when interacting with your own forks. When using `git` protocol it relies on your public ssh key as expected, but for unknown reasons, this will only work if your pub key was not generated with a passphrase.

### WebHook

As part of the whole process, the program will check the existence of a webhook to publish content in Lightbend TechHub. This will fail if you are not an owner on Playframework organisation in GitHub.

## Running

Once you've got the credentials, you can run it:

```
sbt run
```

or

```
sbt run --no-push
```

You will be presented if a few options to choose from. Choose the `main` method you would like to run:

```
Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:

 [1] templatecontrol.RunPlay
 [2] templatecontrol.RunPlay26
 [3] templatecontrol.RunPlay27

Enter number:
```


When using flag `--no-push`, no branch will be pushed and no PRs will be created on GitHub. You can then inspect the modified projects.

### Skipping lines

If you need to skip a line, you can add a `tc-skip` comment on the line you don't want to be replaced.
For example, in case you have a giter8 template with variables, you may want to leave them untouched.

The following line contains a giter8 variable, `$play_version$`,...
```
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.play" % "sbt-plugin" % "$play_version$")
```
this will be replaced by
```
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.play" % "sbt-plugin" % "2.6.19")
```
and that breaks the giter8 template.


If the line contains a `tc-skip`, it won't be touched, for example:
```
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.play" % "sbt-plugin" % "$play_version$") // tc-skip
```
